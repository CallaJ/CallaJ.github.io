In our penultimate deliverable, we explore the use of the "token" in print from 1548 to 2008. Aside from the changes to the meaning of the word itself, which is also very interesting, 
I was very interested in learning how we use visualization to reveal some information about the use of the word against historical context. 
Initially, it appeared the word did not appear in use until around the 1800's, but when I narrowed the focus to look at the years between the first recorded use and 
1800 AD, I could see quite a diffeerent story! Look, there is the beginning of the agricultural revolution....
